## RISC-V Formal Interface

TBD

## XCrypto Formal Interface

The XCrypto Formal Interface (XCFI) is a copy of the RISC-V Formal Interface
(RVFI) used by the `riscv-formal` project/repository, but extended slightly
for use with XCrypto instructions.

- It adds a 3'rd source register address and read data field.

- It adds support for multiple memory transactions per instruction.
